#Simulating Gravity with WebGL

This is the dissertation I wrote in my final year at Newcastle University. The project is hosted at [philellwood.com/nbody](http://philellwood.com/nbody).

I'm not entirely sure why I've uploaded this as a repo on github, other than that it tickled me to do so. Hopefully though, it should be an interesting read, even if it is littered with grammatical errors.
